# DeepAR Filters

This directory contains DeepAR filter files (.deepar).

## How to add filters:

1. Download .deepar filter files from DeepAR's filter library or create your own
2. Place them in this directory
3. Add them to the `assets` section in pubspec.yaml
4. They will be available for use in the app

## Current filters structure:

The following filters are referenced in the code but need to be added:

- aviators.deepar
- beard.deepar
- bigmouth.deepar
- dalmatian.deepar
- flowers.deepar
- koala.deepar
- lion.deepar
- mudmask.deepar
- mustache.deepar
- neondevil.deepar
- pug.deepar
- slash.deepar
- sleepingmask.deepar
- smallface.deepar
- teddycigar.deepar
- tripleface.deepar
- twistedface.deepar

## Note:

These are placeholder files. You need to obtain actual .deepar filter files from:
1. DeepAR's free filter library
2. DeepAR's paid marketplace
3. Custom filters created with DeepAR Studio

For development/testing, you can download sample filters from DeepAR's GitHub repository.
